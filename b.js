If you ever find yourself in the capital, you absolutely must try some of its culinary highlights! 😋💫\n\nIf you're looking for some lip-smacking street food, you can't miss {{{Karim's}}}, near {{{Jama Masjid}}}, famous for its succulent Mughlai cuisine. If you have a sweet tooth, {{{Giani di Hatti}}}, in old Delhi, serves a mean rabri falooda.\n\nFor a more upscale dining experience, head over to {{{Indian Accent}}}. It's one of the best restaurants in the world and showcases a fascinating twist on traditional Indian dishes. 🍽️🍷\n\nLastly, don't forget to swing by {{{Paranthe Wali Gali}}}, a narrow street in old Delhi, dedicated to... you guessed it - paranthas!\nRemember, Delhi's food scene evolves with every nook and corner, map out your hunger trail and keep room for surprises! 😄👍\n\nEnjoy your food odyssey, Gourav!
